# Python
Personal Projects only! I Started learning python on my own in early 2021 and write pretty much everyday now. <br />
During my time in school, I have only taken one class on Python called "Intro to python". The assignments were pretty simple so I won't be uploading those. <br />
Projects: "WFA"

# Tableau

Final Project: "Financial statistics for S&P 500, Gold, and Bitcoin".
