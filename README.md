# Python
Personal Projects only! I Started learning python on my own in early 2021 and write pretty much everyday now. <br />
During my time in school, I have only taken one class on Python called "Intro to python". The assignments were pretty simple so I won't be uploading those. 
Projects: "WFA"

# Tableau
Classes: Data Visualization. <br />
These are a few assignments I worked on for my data visualization class. <br />

# SQL
Classes: Data Modeling and Data Wharehousing. <br />
This class was pretty much learning SQL to work up to one large project at the end. <br />
Final Project: "Douglas_finalproject". <br />


# Excel
Classes: Data Analysis and Knowledge Discovery. Data Analysis with Spreadsheets. <br />
I had two classes geared toward data analysis that required us to use excel throughout the entire course. <br />
